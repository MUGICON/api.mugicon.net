MUGI API is a collection of my personal (can be publicly available for everyone) RESTful APIs. I'm working on it in order to expand more tools for everyone to use.

I'm also working on a document for this project. It's available [here](https://doc.mugicon.net)

If you like this project, please give it a [star](https://github.com/MUGICON/api.mugicon.net/stargazers), I'd be extremely appreciated :)
